SET YOUR LANGUAGE (PLEASE DO NOT IGNORE THIS!):
If this is your first WA-BOT install, you MUST rename your default language.

VERY SIMPLE!
rename default-sample.php to default.php
or
rename your chosen language file to default.php

example your language is espanyol,
just rename es.php => default.php

ADD NEW LANGUAGE:
1. open en.php then copy the contents inside
2. browse to https://translate.google.com
3. paste contents on left-box, choose language on right-box
4. copy translated result (attention, this will be 2 pager translation, click "Next" on blue bar at the bottom)
5. open default.php, delete contents, paste it with the result from previous step.
6. edit! the first _WORD_SHOULD_BE_ENGLISH (sample in en.php).
    watch out for "blank_space" after "define" and after "_", remove the "blank_space"
7. save default.php
